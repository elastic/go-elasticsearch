type CategorizationAnalyzerDefinition struct {
	// CharFilter One or more character filters. In addition to the built-in character filters,
	// other plugins can provide more character filters. If this property is not
	// specified, no character filters are applied prior to categorization. If you
	// are customizing some other aspect of the analyzer and you need to achieve the
	// equivalent of `categorization_filters` (which are not permitted when some
	// other aspect of the analyzer is customized), add them here as pattern replace
	// character filters.
	CharFilter []CharFilter `json:"char_filter,omitempty"`
	// Filter One or more token filters. In addition to the built-in token filters, other
	// plugins can provide more token filters. If this property is not specified, no
	// token filters are applied prior to categorization.
	Filter []TokenFilter `json:"filter,omitempty"`
	// Tokenizer The name or definition of the tokenizer to use after character filters are
	// applied. This property is compulsory if `categorization_analyzer` is
	// specified as an object. Machine learning provides a tokenizer called
	// `ml_standard` that tokenizes in a way that has been determined to produce
	// good categorization results on a variety of log file formats for logs in
	// English. If you want to use that tokenizer but change the character or token
	// filters, specify "tokenizer": "ml_standard" in your
	// `categorization_analyzer`. Additionally, the `ml_classic` tokenizer is
	// available, which tokenizes in the same way as the non-customizable tokenizer
	// in old versions of the product (before 6.2). `ml_classic` was the default
	// categorization tokenizer in versions 6.2 to 7.13, so if you need
	// categorization identical to the default for jobs created in these versions,
	// specify "tokenizer": "ml_classic" in your `categorization_analyzer`.
