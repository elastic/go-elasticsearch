	// AllocateEmptyPrimary Allocate an empty primary shard to a node. Accepts the index and shard for
	// index name and shard number, and node to allocate the shard to. Using this
	// command leads to a complete loss of all data that was indexed into this
	// shard, if it was previously started. If a node which has a copy of the data
	// rejoins the cluster later on, that data will be deleted. To ensure that these
	// implications are well-understood, this command requires the flag
	// accept_data_loss to be explicitly set to true.
	AllocateEmptyPrimary *CommandAllocatePrimaryAction `json:"allocate_empty_primary,omitempty"`
	// AllocateReplica Allocate an unassigned replica shard to a node. Accepts index and shard for
	// index name and shard number, and node to allocate the shard to. Takes
	// allocation deciders into account.
	AllocateReplica *CommandAllocateReplicaAction `json:"allocate_replica,omitempty"`
	// AllocateStalePrimary Allocate a primary shard to a node that holds a stale copy. Accepts the index
	// and shard for index name and shard number, and node to allocate the shard to.
	// Using this command may lead to data loss for the provided shard id. If a node
	// which has the good copy of the data rejoins the cluster later on, that data
	// will be deleted or overwritten with the data of the stale copy that was
	// forcefully allocated with this command. To ensure that these implications are
	// well-understood, this command requires the flag accept_data_loss to be
	// explicitly set to true.
	AllocateStalePrimary *CommandAllocatePrimaryAction `json:"allocate_stale_primary,omitempty"`
	// Cancel Cancel allocation of a shard (or recovery). Accepts index and shard for index
	// name and shard number, and node for the node to cancel the shard allocation
	// on. This can be used to force resynchronization of existing replicas from the
	// primary shard by cancelling them and allowing them to be reinitialized
	// through the standard recovery process. By default only replica shard
	// allocations can be cancelled. If it is necessary to cancel the allocation of
	// a primary shard then the allow_primary flag must also be included in the
	// request.
	Cancel *CommandCancelAction `json:"cancel,omitempty"`
	// Move Move a started shard from one node to another node. Accepts index and shard
	// for index name and shard number, from_node for the node to move the shard
	// from, and to_node for the node to move the shard to.
