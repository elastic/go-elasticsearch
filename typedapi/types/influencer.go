type Influencer struct {
	// BucketSpan The length of the bucket in seconds. This value matches the bucket span that
	// is specified in the job.
	BucketSpan int64 `json:"bucket_span"`
	// Foo Additional influencer properties are added, depending on the fields being
	// analyzed. For example, if itâ€™s
	// analyzing `user_name` as an influencer, a field `user_name` is added to the
	// result document. This
	// information enables you to filter the anomaly results more easily.
	Foo *string `json:"foo,omitempty"`
	// InfluencerFieldName The field name of the influencer.
	InfluencerFieldName string `json:"influencer_field_name"`
	// InfluencerFieldValue The entity that influenced, contributed to, or was to blame for the anomaly.
	InfluencerFieldValue string `json:"influencer_field_value"`
	// InfluencerScore A normalized score between 0-100, which is based on the probability of the
	// influencer in this bucket aggregated
	// across detectors. Unlike `initial_influencer_score`, this value is updated by
	// a re-normalization process as new
	// data is analyzed.
	InfluencerScore float64 `json:"influencer_score"`
	// InitialInfluencerScore A normalized score between 0-100, which is based on the probability of the
	// influencer aggregated across detectors.
	// This is the initial value that was calculated at the time the bucket was
	// processed.
	InitialInfluencerScore float64 `json:"initial_influencer_score"`
	// IsInterim If true, this is an interim result. In other words, the results are
	// calculated based on partial input data.
	IsInterim bool `json:"is_interim"`
	// JobId Identifier for the anomaly detection job.
	JobId string `json:"job_id"`
	// Probability The probability that the influencer has this behavior, in the range 0 to 1.
	// This value can be held to a high
	// precision of over 300 decimal places, so the `influencer_score` is provided
	// as a human-readable and friendly
	// interpretation of this value.
	Probability float64 `json:"probability"`
	// ResultType Internal. This value is always set to `influencer`.
	ResultType string `json:"result_type"`
	// Timestamp The start time of the bucket for which these results were calculated.
	Timestamp int64 `json:"timestamp"`
