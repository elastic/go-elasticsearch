	// AllocationDelay Only valid if type is restart.
	// Controls how long Elasticsearch will wait for the node to restart and join
	// the cluster before reassigning its shards to other nodes.
	// This works the same as delaying allocation with the
	// index.unassigned.node_left.delayed_timeout setting.
	// If you specify both a restart allocation delay and an index-level allocation
	// delay, the longer of the two is used.
	AllocationDelay *string `json:"allocation_delay,omitempty"`
	// Reason A human-readable reason that the node is being shut down.
	// This field provides information for other cluster operators; it does not
	// affect the shut down process.
	Reason string `json:"reason"`
	// TargetNodeName Only valid if type is replace.
	// Specifies the name of the node that is replacing the node being shut down.
	// Shards from the shut down node are only allowed to be allocated to the target
	// node, and no other data will be allocated to the target node.
	// During relocation of data certain allocation rules are ignored, such as disk
	// watermarks or user attribute filtering rules.
	TargetNodeName *string `json:"target_node_name,omitempty"`
	// Type Valid values are restart, remove, or replace.
	// Use restart when you need to temporarily shut down a node to perform an
	// upgrade, make configuration changes, or perform other maintenance.
	// Because the node is expected to rejoin the cluster, data is not migrated off
	// of the node.
	// Use remove when you need to permanently remove a node from the cluster.
	// The node is not marked ready for shutdown until data is migrated off of the
	// node Use replace to do a 1:1 replacement of a node with another node.
	// Certain allocation decisions will be ignored (such as disk watermarks) in the
	// interest of true replacement of the source node with the target node.
	// During a replace-type shutdown, rollover and index creation may result in
	// unassigned shards, and shrink may fail until the replacement is complete.
