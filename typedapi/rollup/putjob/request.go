type Request struct {

	// Cron A cron string which defines the intervals when the rollup job should be
	// executed. When the interval
	// triggers, the indexer attempts to rollup the data in the index pattern. The
	// cron pattern is unrelated
	// to the time interval of the data being rolled up. For example, you may wish
	// to create hourly rollups
	// of your document but to only run the indexer on a daily basis at midnight, as
	// defined by the cron. The
	// cron pattern is defined just like a Watcher cron schedule.
	Cron string `json:"cron"`
	// Groups Defines the grouping fields and aggregations that are defined for this rollup
	// job. These fields will then be
	// available later for aggregating into buckets. These aggs and fields can be
	// used in any combination. Think of
	// the groups configuration as defining a set of tools that can later be used in
	// aggregations to partition the
	// data. Unlike raw data, we have to think ahead to which fields and
	// aggregations might be used. Rollups provide
	// enough flexibility that you simply need to determine which fields are needed,
	// not in what order they are needed.
	Groups  types.Groupings   `json:"groups"`
	Headers types.HttpHeaders `json:"headers,omitempty"`
	// IndexPattern The index or index pattern to roll up. Supports wildcard-style patterns
	// (`logstash-*`). The job attempts to
	// rollup the entire index or index-pattern.
	IndexPattern string `json:"index_pattern"`
	// Metrics Defines the metrics to collect for each grouping tuple. By default, only the
	// doc_counts are collected for each
	// group. To make rollup useful, you will often add metrics like averages, mins,
	// maxes, etc. Metrics are defined
	// on a per-field basis and for each field you configure which metric should be
	// collected.
	Metrics []types.FieldMetric `json:"metrics,omitempty"`
	// PageSize The number of bucket results that are processed on each iteration of the
	// rollup indexer. A larger value tends
	// to execute faster, but requires more memory during processing. This value has
	// no effect on how the data is
	// rolled up; it is merely used for tweaking the speed or memory cost of the
	// indexer.
	PageSize int `json:"page_size"`
	// RollupIndex The index that contains the rollup results. The index can be shared with
	// other rollup jobs. The data is stored so that it doesnâ€™t interfere with
	// unrelated jobs.
	RollupIndex string `json:"rollup_index"`
	// Timeout Time to wait for the request to complete.
	Timeout types.Duration `json:"timeout,omitempty"`
