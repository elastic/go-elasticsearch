	// AllowLazyStart Specifies whether this job can start when there is insufficient machine
	// learning node capacity for it to be immediately assigned to a node. If
	// set to `false` and a machine learning node with capacity to run the job
	// cannot be immediately found, the API returns an error. If set to `true`,
	// the API does not return an error; the job waits in the `starting` state
	// until sufficient machine learning node capacity is available. This
	// behavior is also affected by the cluster-wide
	// `xpack.ml.max_lazy_ml_nodes` setting.
	AllowLazyStart *bool `json:"allow_lazy_start,omitempty"`
	// Analysis The analysis configuration, which contains the information necessary to
	// perform one of the following types of analysis: classification, outlier
	// detection, or regression.
	Analysis types.DataframeAnalysisContainer `json:"analysis"`
	// AnalyzedFields Specifies `includes` and/or `excludes` patterns to select which fields
	// will be included in the analysis. The patterns specified in `excludes`
	// are applied last, therefore `excludes` takes precedence. In other words,
	// if the same field is specified in both `includes` and `excludes`, then
	// the field will not be included in the analysis. If `analyzed_fields` is
	// not set, only the relevant fields will be included. For example, all the
	// numeric fields for outlier detection.
	// The supported fields vary for each type of analysis. Outlier detection
	// requires numeric or `boolean` data to analyze. The algorithms don’t
	// support missing values therefore fields that have data types other than
	// numeric or boolean are ignored. Documents where included fields contain
	// missing values, null values, or an array are also ignored. Therefore the
	// `dest` index may contain documents that don’t have an outlier score.
	// Regression supports fields that are numeric, `boolean`, `text`,
	// `keyword`, and `ip` data types. It is also tolerant of missing values.
	// Fields that are supported are included in the analysis, other fields are
	// ignored. Documents where included fields contain an array with two or
	// more values are also ignored. Documents in the `dest` index that don’t
	// contain a results field are not included in the regression analysis.
	// Classification supports fields that are numeric, `boolean`, `text`,
	// `keyword`, and `ip` data types. It is also tolerant of missing values.
	// Fields that are supported are included in the analysis, other fields are
	// ignored. Documents where included fields contain an array with two or
	// more values are also ignored. Documents in the `dest` index that don’t
	// contain a results field are not included in the classification analysis.
	// Classification analysis can be improved by mapping ordinal variable
	// values to a single number. For example, in case of age ranges, you can
	// model the values as `0-14 = 0`, `15-24 = 1`, `25-34 = 2`, and so on.
	AnalyzedFields *types.DataframeAnalysisAnalyzedFields `json:"analyzed_fields,omitempty"`
	// Description A description of the job.

	Headers types.HttpHeaders                   `json:"headers,omitempty"`
	// MaxNumThreads The maximum number of threads to be used by the analysis. Using more
	// threads may decrease the time necessary to complete the analysis at the
	// cost of using more CPU. Note that the process may use additional threads
	// for operational functionality other than the analysis itself.
	MaxNumThreads *int `json:"max_num_threads,omitempty"`
	// ModelMemoryLimit The approximate maximum amount of memory resources that are permitted for
	// analytical processing. If your `elasticsearch.yml` file contains an
	// `xpack.ml.max_model_memory_limit` setting, an error occurs when you try
	// to create data frame analytics jobs that have `model_memory_limit` values
	// greater than that setting.
	ModelMemoryLimit *string `json:"model_memory_limit,omitempty"`
