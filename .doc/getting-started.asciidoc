== Getting started

This page guides you through the installation process of the Go client, shows 
you how to instantiate the client, and how to perform basic Elasticsearch 
operations with it. You can use the client with either a low-level API or a 
fully typed API. This getting started shows you examples of both APIs.

=== Installation 

To install the latest version of the client, run the following command:

[source,shell]
--------------------------

=== Connecting

You can connect to the Elastic Cloud using an API key and the Elasticsearch 
endpoint. 

[source,go]
----

----

Your Elasticsearch endpoint can be found on the **My deployment** page of your 
deployment:

=== Operations

Time to use Elasticsearch! This section walks you through the basic, and most 
important, operations of Elasticsearch. For more operations and more advanced 
examples, refer to the <<examples>> page.

==== Creating an index

This is how you create the `my_index` index with the low level API:

[source,go]
----

----

This is how you create the `my_index` index with the fully-typed API:

[source,go]
----

----


[discrete]
==== Indexing documents

This is a simple way of indexing a document by using the low-level API:

[source,go]
----

----

The same operation by using the fully-typed API:

[source,go]
----

----

[discrete]
==== Getting documents

You can get documents by using the following code with the low-level API:

[source,go]
----

----

This is how you can get documents by using the fully-typed API:

[source,go]
----

----


[discrete]
==== Searching documents

This is how you can create a single match query with the low-level API: 

[source,go]
----

----

You can perform a single match query with the fully-tpyed API, too:

[source,go]
----

[discrete]
==== Updating documents

This is how you can update a document, for example to add a new field, by using 
the low-level API:

[source,go]
----

----

And this is how you can update a document with the fully-typed API:

[source,go]
----
