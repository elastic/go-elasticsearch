=== ES|QL in the Go client

This page helps you understand and use {ref}/esql.html[ES|QL] in the
Go client.

There are two ways to use ES|QL in the Go client:

* Use the Elasticsearch {es-docs}/esql-apis.html[ES|QL API] directly: This
is the most flexible approach, but it's also the most complex because you must handle
results in their raw form. You can choose the precise format of results,
such as JSON, CSV, or text.
* Use ES|QL mapping helpers: These mappers take care of parsing the raw
response into something readily usable by the application. Several mappers are
available for different use cases, such as object mapping, cursor
traversal of results, and dataframes. You can also define your own mapper for specific
use cases.

==== How to use the ES|QL API

The {es-docs}/esql-query-api.html[ES|QL query API] allows you to specify how
results should be returned. You can choose a
{es-docs}/esql-rest.html#esql-rest-format[response format] such as CSV, text, or
JSON, then fine-tune it with parameters like column separators
and locale.

// Add any Go-specific usage notes

The following example gets ES|QL results as CSV and parses them:

[[esql-consume-results]]
==== Consume ES|QL results

The previous example showed that although the raw ES|QL API offers maximum
flexibility, additional work is required in order to make use of the
result data.

To simplify things, try working with these three main representations of ES|QL
results (each with its own mapping helper):

* **Objects**, where each row in the results is mapped to an object from your
application domain. This is similar to what ORMs (object relational mappers)
commonly do.
* **Cursors**, where you scan the results row by row and access the data using
column names. This is similar to database access libraries.
* **Dataframes**, where results are organized in a column-oriented structure that
allows efficient processing of column data.

// Code examples to be written for each of them, depending on availability in the language

[[esql-custom-mapping]]
==== Define your own mapping

Although the mappers provided by the Go client cover many use cases, your
application might require a custom mapping.
You can write your own mapper and use it in a similar way as the
built-in ones.

Note that mappers are meant to provide a more usable representation of ES|QL
resultsâ€”not to process the result data. Data processing should be based on
the output of a result mapper.

Here's an example mapper that returns a simple column-oriented
representation of the data:
