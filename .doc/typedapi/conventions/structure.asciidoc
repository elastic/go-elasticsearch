==== Structure

The Typed client lives in the `typedapi` package within the `go-elasticsearch` repository.

The entire client is summed in an index at the root of the package for convenient access after instantiation.

Each endpoint resides in its own package within `typedapi` and contains the client for this endpoint, and the `Request` struct if applicable.

The requests are based on a collection of structures generated from the https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification[elasticsearch-specification] repository and gathered in a `types` package within `typedapi`.
